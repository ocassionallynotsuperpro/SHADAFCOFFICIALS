								<h2>About SHADA FC</h2>
								<h3>Rising from a small local squad to a competitive semi-professional team.</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								SHADA FC is a rising football club that has quickly begun to make its mark in Cambodian
								football. Founded only two years ago, the club has grown from a small local team into a
								competitive squad now officially signed into the Cambodian Second Division League, a
								semi-professional competition that showcases emerging talent across the country. Despite
								its young age, SHADA FC has already achieved notable success, earning more than one
								trophy and developing a strong reputation for discipline, teamwork, and ambition.
							</p>
							<p>
								The club is home to 25 dedicated players, each committed to improving their skills and
								contributing to the team’s overall growth. These players bring a combination of passion,
								determination, and unity that reflects the identity of SHADA FC. Their hard work both on
								and off the field has played a major role in the rapid progress the club has achieved
								within such a short period.

								SHADA FC is owned by CEO Semo Elfar, whose leadership and support have laid the
								foundation for the club’s development. Under his guidance, the club has been able to
								build a stable structure, create opportunities for young talents, and maintain a strong
								vision for the future. His dedication is one of the key reasons the club continues to
								move forward confidently.
							</p>
							<p>
								On the sporting side, the team’s success is shaped by the professional guidance of Head
								Coach Nelson and Assistant Coach Omar. Their combined experience, strategic planning,
								and commitment to player improvement have helped SHADA FC build a strong tactical
								identity. Coach Nelson focuses on discipline, fitness, and strategic gameplay, while
								Assistant Coach Omar supports player development and team coordination. Together, they
								form a leadership team that understands the club’s goals and works tirelessly to achieve
								them.

								Although SHADA FC has only been active for two years, its achievements are already
								impressive. With trophies earned, a growing fan base, and entry into the
								semi-professional league, the club stands as a symbol of ambition and determination.
								SHADA FC is more than just a football team—it is a project built on passion, teamwork,
								and a vision for long-term success. As the club continues to grow, it aims to rise
								through the ranks of Cambodian football and inspire young players across the nation.
